We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

- Personal attacks or insults  
- Publishing private information of others without consent  
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate
